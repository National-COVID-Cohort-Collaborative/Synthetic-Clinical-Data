**Welcome to the N3C Synthetic Clinical Data Workstream**

**Our work.** 
In collaboration with other N3C workstreams, we will create a ”pipeline” that can be used to generate computationally derived synthetic clinical data, in support of COVID related analytics.

**If you’re a new N3C site:** 
You may want to start with the [documentation ](https://github.com/National-COVID-Cohort-Collaborative/Synthetic-Clinical-Data/wiki). 

**Want to work with us? How to get involved.** 
We encourage participation from the community! If you have a bug or an idea, browse the open issues before opening a new one. Please use the GitHub issue tracker to submit any comments or suggestions.

**Where to find known issues**
We are using[ Github issues](https://github.com/National-COVID-Cohort-Collaborative/Synthetic-Clinical-Data).

**How to connect with us.** Want to ask a question or just say hi? We’d love to hear from you. If you have already onboarded you can find us on the #n3c-phenotype channel on Slack.  To learn more about the N3C and onboard, please visit us [here](https://covid.cd2h.org/N3C). 

**Reporting new issues**
The best way for your bug to get fixed is to open a GitHub Issue and provide enough information for us to try and replicate what you’re seeing. Useful information includes the database management system you’re using, the data model you’re running, the database client you’re using, your operating system, etc. 

**Taking it to Slack**
It’s important to us that we are able to do our best work and be good members in the community. If we need to understand more about your issue, we will share a quick message with you on the CD2H Slack.  That way we will never clog your inbox over this!

**Documentation**
We will use the [Wiki ](https://github.com/National-COVID-Cohort-Collaborative/Synthetic-Clinical-Data/wiki)on this repo to share all documentation. Please take a look!
